# Sound Healing: The Effect of Music and Age on Various Mental Health Conditions

## Objective

The primary objective of this project shifted from solely focusing on the impact of different music genres to also examining how age affects self-reported mental health conditions. We aimed to answer: "Do specific age groups have a statistically significant positive or negative effect on self-reported stress, anxiety, or depression levels?"

## Research Questions

1. Do certain music genres have a statistically significant positive or negative effect on self-reported stress, anxiety, or depression levels?
2. Is there a genre-specific pattern in music listening among people who report particular mental health conditions?
3. Are there demographic factors, especially age, that influence the effectiveness of certain genres or tempo (BPM) on mental health?

## Data Source

The data for this project comes from the MxMH dataset, which aims to identify correlations between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health.

## Methodology

- Descriptive Statistics
- Correlation and Causation Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis including Linear and Logistic Regression Models
- Data Visualization

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Statsmodels
- Seaborn/Matplotlib

## Key Findings

- Age is a significant factor in how music affects self-reported mental health conditions.
- There's a nuanced relationship between BPM, hours of listening, and self-reported anxiety levels across various age groups.

## Limitations

- The study does not imply causation.
- Limited to self-reported data which might have inherent biases.
