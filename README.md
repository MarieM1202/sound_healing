# Sound Healing: How Music Genres Correlate with Mental Health

## Project Description

In this data science project, we delve deep into the MxMH dataset to explore the relationship between musical preferences and mental health conditions. Utilizing statistical analysis, machine learning techniques, and compelling visualizations, we aim to shed light on how different genres of music may serve as therapeutic catalysts for mental well-being. The insights generated from this project could serve as valuable contributions to the evolving field of Music Therapy.
